# codex-ultrawork

Codex plugin that injects a compact orchestration directive (the **ultrawork** prompt) when the user prompt contains `ultrawork` or `ulw` (word-bounded, case-insensitive). It also syncs the bundled `codex-ultrawork-reviewer` agent role into `CODEX_HOME/agents` on `SessionStart`.

## What the injected directive enforces

| Mandate | Behavior |
|---|---|
| Goal + binding success criteria | Call `create_goal` (or open with a `# Goal` block) listing the deliverable + **3+ realistic QA scenarios** (happy path, edge cases, adjacent-surface regression). Each scenario MUST name which **Manual-QA channel** it will use. "Tests pass" is supporting signal, NEVER completion proof. |
| Manual-QA channels (TESTS ALONE NEVER PROVE DONE) | A dedicated top-level section enumerates the **four** channels you can use to verify a criterion in reality: **(1) HTTP call** (`curl -i` / Playwright APIRequestContext), **(2) tmux** (`tmux new-session` + `send-keys` + `capture-pane`), **(3) Browser use** (Playwright / puppeteer / Chromium driving the real page), **(4) Computer use** (OS-level GUI automation against the running app). Every criterion picks one channel, builds a real-usage scenario, runs it, and captures the artifact — every time. Aux surfaces (CLI stdout / DB diff / parsed config) only count for genuinely CLI- or data-shaped criteria. |
| Surface + paired cleanup | Execution loop step 4 (**SURFACE-AS-SCENARIO**) runs the chosen channel scenario end-to-end. Step 5 (**CLEANUP, PAIRED**) tears down every QA-spawned process / tmux session / browser context / container / port / temp dir, with a one-line receipt appended to the notepad. Leftover state → NOT done. |
| Durable /tmp notepad | `mktemp -t ulw-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M%S).XXXXXX.md` with sections `Plan`, `Success criteria + QA scenarios`, `Now`, `Todo`, `Findings`, `Learnings`. **Append**, never rewrite. |
| Obsessive atomic todos | Every action — even one-line edits, `ls`, single test runs — becomes a todo. Format: `path: <action> for <criterion> — verify by <check>`. One in_progress at a time, mark completed immediately. |
| GPT-5.2 xhigh verification gate | Triggered automatically on user-requested rigor, 3+ files, 20+ turns, 30+ minutes, or refactor/migration/perf/security work. Use the bundled `codex-ultrawork-reviewer` agent role when available. Reviewer verdict is **binding** — no "false positive", no minimising, no arguing. Loop until **unconditional** approval. "Looks good but…" = REJECTION. |

The directive is currently 11,005 chars / 232 lines and follows the GPT-5.5 prompting structure (Role / Goal / Manual-QA channels / Bootstrap / Execution loop / Verification gate / Commits / Constraints / Output / Stop rules).

## Install (via this marketplace)

```bash
codex plugin marketplace add /path/to/codex-plugins
node /path/to/codex-plugins/scripts/install-local.mjs /path/to/codex-plugins
```

The installer copies the plugin into `~/.codex/plugins/cache/code-yeongyu-codex-plugins/omo/0.1.0`, enables it in `~/.codex/config.toml`, and registers the `UserPromptSubmit` and `SessionStart` hooks.

## How it works

`hooks/hooks.json` registers a `UserPromptSubmit` hook running:

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/ultrawork-detector.py
```

Codex passes the prompt payload on stdin. When the pattern `\b(?:ultrawork|ulw)\b` (case-insensitive) matches, the hook writes the directive to stdout — Codex injects non-JSON stdout as `additional_context` for the next turn. Otherwise the hook writes nothing and exits 0. Malformed input also exits 0 to never block the turn.

It also registers a `SessionStart` hook running:

```
python3 ${PLUGIN_ROOT}/hooks/sync-agents.py
```

That hook copies bundled `agents/*.toml` files into `CODEX_HOME/agents`. It writes nothing on success and exits 0 even on malformed input.

## Smoke test

```bash
PAYLOAD='{"cwd":"/tmp","hook_event_name":"UserPromptSubmit","model":"gpt-5.5","permission_mode":"default","session_id":"x","transcript_path":"","turn_id":"y","prompt":"please ultrawork"}'
echo "$PAYLOAD" | python3 hooks/ultrawork-detector.py | head -3
```

Expect `<ultrawork-mode>` ... directive body.

## Agent role smoke test

```bash
CODEX_HOME="$(mktemp -d)"
echo '{"hook_event_name":"SessionStart"}' | CODEX_HOME="$CODEX_HOME" python3 hooks/sync-agents.py
```

Expect `CODEX_HOME/agents/codex-ultrawork-reviewer.toml` to exist.

## Privacy

This plugin only reads local hook payloads, emits the bundled directive text on keyword match, and syncs bundled agent TOML files locally. It does not perform network requests or telemetry.
